          With a solid background in computer science, I have explored both web
          and mobile development through various courses, bootcamps, and
          internships. Iâ€™ve worked on fullstack projects, built mobile
          applications, and now Iâ€™m focusing on seeking opportunities to
          broaden my experience through internships or professional roles.
